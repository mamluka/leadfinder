        <p>These filters are developed based on our proprietary daily feed of 20 million telcom records which enable us to analyze response propensity as additional performance indicators that none of our competitors are able to offer.
            Records that are not flagged as a responders should not be considered non-responders. We are only able to validate responder records based on our internal responder data set which does not allow for filtering of a large
            percentage of records.</p>

        </p>Testing shows that data performance can increase up to 300% based on these features.</p>
